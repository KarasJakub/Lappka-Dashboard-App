# Łappka Dashboard App

## Status: `In progress`

## Description

The primary goal of the Łappka application was to bring together animal shelters from Poland into one centralized platform. Through the management panel, shelters could register and efficiently manage their animals, staff, and volunteers. Simultaneously, the mobile app for clients allowed them to discover and adopt their beloved pets while also reporting any lost animals. I had the opportunity to contribute to this project during my participation in the Mobitouch mLAB internship.
